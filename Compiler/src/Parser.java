/*
 *  Implement the class Parser, the syntax analyzer (parser). 
 *  This should be a top-down recursivedescent parser for the grammar G above. 
 *  The output of the parser is the stack-based intermediate code S, corresponding to the given program, 
 *  written to standard output (stdout). 
 *  If the expression is not in the language (or if an ERROR token is returned by the Lexer) 
 *  then the parser should output the error message “Syntax error!” 
 *  (at the point when the error is recognized) and immediately quit.
 *	
 *	The parser should have at least two (private) member variables, one of type Lexer, 
 *	the other of type Token (for the current token). 
 *	It should only have a single public method, parse(), 
 *	for initiating the parse – other methods are private.
